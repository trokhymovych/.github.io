I am Mykola Trokhymovych, a PhD candidate at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), 
affiliated with the Web Science and Social Computing Research Group. 
I am co-advised by Dr. Diego Saez-Trumper and Prof. Ricardo Baeza-Yates. 
My research interests lie in data science, with a particular focus on 
natural language processing, generative AI, 
fact-checking, and computational social science. Additionally, 
I collaborate with the Wikimedia Research Team to contribute to the improvement of Wikipedia.
