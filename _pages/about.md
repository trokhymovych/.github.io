I am Mykola Trokhymovych, a PhD candidate at Universitat Pompeu Fabra
within the [Web Science and Social Computing Research Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/wssc). 
I am co-advised by [Dr. Diego Saez-Trumper](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Diego_(WMF))
and [Prof. Ricardo Baeza-Yates](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~rbaeza/).
My academic interests center around data science, with a specific focus on `Fact-checking`, `Generative AI`, and `Computational Social Science`. 
Also, I actively collaborate with the Wikimedia Research Team to contribute to improving `Wikipedia`.

I have `5+ years` of industry experience as a `Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer`, having worked in large outsourcing firms, product companies, and startups. 
My professional expertise primarily lies in `Information Retrieval`, `Ranking`, `Recommender Systems`, and `NLP`.
