abstract = {This paper presents a novel design of the system aimed at supporting the Wikipedia community in addressing vandalism on the platform. To achieve this, we collected a massive dataset of 47 languages, and applied advanced filtering and feature engineering techniques, including multilingual masked language modeling to build the training dataset from human-generated data. The performance of the system was evaluated through comparison with the one used in production in Wikipedia, known as ORES. Our research results in a significant increase in the number of languages covered, making Wikipedia patrolling more efficient to a wider range of communities. Furthermore, our model outperforms ORES, ensuring that the results provided are not only more accurate but also less biased against certain groups of contributors.},

abstract = {With the growth of fake news and disinformation, the NLP community has been working to assist humans in fact-checking. However, most academic research has focused on model accuracy without paying attention to resource efficiency, which is crucial in real-life scenarios. In this work, we review the State-of-the-Art datasets and solutions for Automatic Fact-checking and test their applicability in production environments. We discover overfitting issues in those models, and we propose a data filtering method that improves the model's performance and generalization. Then, we design an unsupervised fine-tuning of the Masked Language models to improve its accuracy working with Wikipedia. We also propose a novel query enhancing method to improve evidence discovery using the Wikipedia Search API. Finally, we present a new fact-checking system, the WikiCheck API that automatically performs a facts validation process based on the Wikipedia knowledge base. It is comparable to SOTA solutions in terms of accuracy and can be used on low-memory CPU instances.},
